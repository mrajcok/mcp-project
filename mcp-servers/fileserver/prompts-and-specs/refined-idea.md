### Summary of the Idea

#### 1. **Core Idea**
The project aims to develop an **MCP server** that provides a secure and efficient way to handle a predefined set of filesystem operations over a network. The focus is on implementing these operations in a robust and reliable manner.

---

#### 2. **Key Features and Requirements**
- **Filesystem Operations**:
  - Support for specific operations such as listing directories, reading file metadata, and other core filesystem tasks.
  - Ensure compatibility with the MCP protocol for all operations.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Basic authentication to restrict access to authorized users.
  - Role-based permissions for accessing specific filesystem operations.

- **Security**:
  - Secure communication over the network (e.g., TLS/SSL).
  - Logging of all operations for auditing purposes.

- **Integration**:
  - Provide a clean API for clients to interact with the MCP server.
    Files and directories should be exposed as MCP server resources to provide read-only data (e.g., file contents, directory listings) for the LLM's context.
    Actions should be exposed as MCP tools, such as creating, modifying, or deleting files/directories to handle side effects.
    Use resources like /resources/file and /resources/dir for reading and tools like /tools/create_file for actions.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing tools or systems that rely on MCP.

---

#### 3. **Technical Considerations**
- **Programming Languages**:
  - Python 3.12 in a virtual environment for dependency management.

- **Frameworks and Tools**:
  - Use **FastMCP 2.0** (https://gofastmcp.com) for implementing the MCP protocol.
  - Minimal dependencies to ensure simplicity and maintainability.

- **Configuration**:
  - Use a YAML file to configure server settings, such as the list of directories the server is allowed to access.

- **Deployment**:
  - Local development and Dockerized for easy deployment and testing.
  - Include a `run.sh` script for quick local development setup.
  - Configuration options for different environments (e.g., development, production).

- **Security**:
  - HTTPS transport for secure communication.
  - Bearer token authentication for all requests.
  - User ID included in requests for rate limiting and usage monitoring.

#### 4. **Supported Tools**

The MCP server will support the following tools:

- **read_text_file**  
  Read the contents of a file as text. Always treats the file as UTF-8 text regardless of extension.  
  **Inputs**:  
    - `path` (string): File location.  
    - `head` (number, optional): First N lines.  
    - `tail` (number, optional): Last N lines.  

- **create_file**  
  Create a new file if it doesn't already exist.  
  **Inputs**:  
    - `path` (string): File location.  
    - `content` (string): File content.  

- **append_file**  
  Append contents to a file.  
  **Inputs**:  
    - `path` (string): File to edit.  
    - `content` (string): Content to append.  

- **create_directory**  
  Create a new directory or ensure it exists.  
  **Input**:  
    - `path` (string): Directory location.  
  Creates parent directories if needed. Succeeds silently if the directory already exists.  

- **list_directory**  
  List the contents of a directory.  
  **Input**:  
    - `path` (string): Directory location.  
  **Returns**:  
    - List of files and directories in the specified path.  
    - Each entry includes:  
      - `name`  
      - `type` (file/directory)  
      - `size` (for files)  
      - `modified time`  
      - `permissions` (read/write/execute)  

- **find_files**  
  Recursively search for files or directories.  
  **Inputs**:  
    - `path` (string): Starting directory.  
    - `pattern` (string): Search pattern.  
    - `excludePatterns` (string[]): Patterns to exclude (supports glob formats).  
  **Returns**:  
    - Full paths to matches.  

- **grep_files**  
  Search for text in files.  
  **Inputs**:  
    - `path` (string): Directory to search.  
    - `pattern` (string): Text pattern to match.  
    - `excludePatterns` (string[]): Patterns to exclude (supports glob formats).  
  **Returns**:  
    - List of files containing the pattern, with line numbers and the matched line content.  

- **get_file_info**  
  Get detailed metadata for a file or directory.  
  **Input**:  
    - `path` (string): File or directory location.  
  **Returns**:  
    - `size`  
    - `creation time`  
    - `modified time`  
    - `access time`  
    - `type` (file/directory)  
    - `permissions`  

- **list_allowed_directories**  
  List all directories the server is allowed to access.  
  **No Input Required**  
  **Returns**:  
    - Directories that the server can read/write from.

#### 5. **Additional Notes**
- The project is intentionally scoped to avoid unnecessary complexity, focusing solely on the MCP protocol and its filesystem operations.
- Future iterations could explore additional features if needed, but the current goal is to deliver a minimal, functional MCP server.
