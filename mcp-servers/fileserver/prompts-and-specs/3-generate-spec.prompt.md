Now that we've wrapped up the brainstorming process and documented the idea in refined-idea.md, compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification. Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

NOTE: there doesn't seem to be a way to include a file in the prompt, so paste the above content into the vscode chat window and add the refined-idea.md file as context.
