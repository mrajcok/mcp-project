1. Open `@mcp-servers/fileserver/prompts-and-specs/prompt_plan.md` and identify any prompts not marked as implemented/completed.
2. For each incomplete prompt:
    - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
    - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
    - Otherwise, implement it as described.
    - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
    - Update `@prompt_plan.md` to mark this prompt as implemented/completed.
3. After you finish each prompt, pause and wait for user review or feedback.
4. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.
5. If you encounter any issues or need clarification, ask the user for guidance.
