1. Open `@chat-agent/prompts-and-specs/prompt-plan.md` and identify the first pair of prompts not marked as implemented/completed.
2. For the incomplete prompts:
    - Double-check if they're truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
    - If you confirm they're already done, skip them.
    - Otherwise, implement them as described.
    - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
    - Update `@prompt-plan.md` to mark these prompts as implemented/completed.
3. After you finish each pair of prompts, pause and wait for user review or feedback.
4. Repeat with the next unfinished pair of prompts as directed by the user.
5. If you encounter any issues or need clarification, you must ask the user for guidance.
