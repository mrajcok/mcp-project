description: 'interact with me to help hone an idea and generate a detailed specification for a developer'

You are an expert systems engineer that is very knowledgeable about the following:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
- AI agents and implementing them with Pydantic AI
- Python programming
- writing secure web applications
You will help me develop a detailed specification for the software idea detailed below by asking me questions and iterating on my answers.
You will ask me one question at a time, and I will answer.
I prefer yes/no answers, but you can ask for more detail if needed.
You will use my answers to refine your next question, digging into every relevant detail.
You will not write any code or generate any text other than questions while we hone the idea.
You will not suggest any code or implementation details until we have a complete specification.
You will not make any assumptions about the idea or the specification. You will ask me for clarification rather than making assumptions.

The idea is to create a AI agent web application that is also an MCP host that implements MCP clients to connect to MCP servers.
All MCP clients will connect to MCP servers using the HTTP transport, secured for both local development and Docker Swarm deployment.
A list of MCP servers will be provided in the configuration YAML file, and the agent will connect to them as needed.
The home page of the web application will indicate the connection status of each MCP server and the tools available on each server.
The AI agent will also be able to interact with a (configured) large language model (LLM) using its API to help it determine which MCP servers to use to perform actions and retrieve data.

The user can use natural language to interact with the agent, and the agent will use the configured LLM to help it determine which MCP servers to use to perform actions and retrieve data.
The user can also use #tool_name to invoke a specific tool on a specific MCP server, such as #read_text_file or #create_file.

The application will have a web interface where users can chat with the agent. 
The agent will default to using the OpenAI API as its LLM.

If the user is not logged in, a login page will be displayed.
Users will authenticate with the application with a username and LDAP password.
LDAP password verification should be mocked for local development, but in production the LDAP server will be a corporate LDAP server.
In addition, the user must be in the application's configuration YAML file (e.g., config authorized_users) in order to be granted access to the application.
Once a user is authenticated, a token is generated and stored in an sqlite database associated with the user, if a token does not already exist for the user.
The token is a bearer token that is included in every request sent to an MCP server, used for authentication with the MCP server.
Once a user authenticates, a session is also created for the user, backed by the sqlite database.

The application will log all chat messages the user sent to the agent in the database.
The user can view their chat history, paginated, in the web interface.
Chat messages will be stored for a limited (configurable) time, such as 180 days, and then deleted.
If a chat message causes any MCP server actions, the application will log the actions along with the chat in the in the database.

The application will rate limit each user's chat messages to prevent abuse, denial of service attacks, and other malicious behavior.
The rate limit will be configurable, such as 10 messages per minute, and will be enforced by the application.
If any user exceeds the rate limit, the application will enter a degraded state where
all chat messages will return an error message indicating that possible malicious behavior has been detected.  The application will remain in the degraded state indefinitely--i.e., it
will require a manual restart to get the application out of the degraded state.
The application will also log the rate limit violation in the database.

The web interface should have a nav bar with the following links:
- Chat Agent: the home page of the application
- History: The chat history page where the user can view their chat history, paginated.
- Admin (if the user is an administrator): The admin page where the user can view usage statistics and graphs.
- username: The username of the authenticated user.
- Logout: Log out of the application.

The main area of the home page should show the chat input box and then below that the AI agent/assistant output box. The output box should display the user chat message and the agent response. The user chat should be displayed in a different color than the agent response.
On the left side of the home page, there should be a list of MCP servers with their connection status and available tools.

The agent response must clearly indicate any MCP server actions that were performed as a result of the user chat message. If any MCP server action requires modifying a file or directory, the agent must first get approval from the user before performing the action.

A configurable set of users will be designated as administrators in the configuration YAML file.
Administrators will have access to an admin page in the web application where they can view usage statistics and graphs, such as:
- number of chat messages per user over time, as a dash graph
- MCP server actions over time, as a dash graph
- rate limit violations
- other graphs as needed
Administrators will have a nav bar at the top of the page to view the admin page.

All user logins, chat messages and calls to the LLM and MCP servers will be logged to stdout, since in production the application will be running in a Docker container.

All of what follows will be part of the specification that will be generated, and this information does not need to be refined further while helping me hone the idea.

Technology stack:
- Python 3.12 virtual environment for dependencies
- ldap3 for LDAP authentication, https://ldap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- FastMCP 2.0, https://gofastmcp.com, for the MCP host and clients
- Pydantic AI, https://ai.pydantic.dev/, for the AI agent functionality
- OpenAI API for the large language model (LLM)
- SQLite for server-side sessions, token storage, usage tracking and rate limiting, chat history, and action history
- Docker for containerization and deployment
- Dash 3.x for the web interface, https://dash.plotly.com
  - The web interface should use server-sent events (SSE) to stream responses from the agent to the web client.
  - Flask-Session with Flask-SQLAlchemy for session management and general state management, https://flask-session.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Implementation details:
- YAML file for configuration, such as the list of directories that the server is
allowed access to.
- run.sh script for quick start local development
