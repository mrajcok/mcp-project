# Copilot agent instructions
Be somewhat terse in what you tell me in the chat window, since
I want to minimize how many AI model output tokens I use.

# Development Guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Use proper logging
- **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic models for all data structures

# Journaling
If you have journaling capabilities, use them to document your interactions with me and the codebase.

# Writing code

- Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUT-ME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without explicit permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new someday will be "old" someday.

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something the user might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.
- NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you need the user to approve before proceeding.

## Use TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix
- Always use a test database for tests, never the real/production database

## Error Handling
- Learning-Focused Error Response
  When encountering tool failures (pytest, etc.):
  - Treat each failure as a learning opportunity, not an obstacle
  - Research the specific error before attempting fixes
  - Explain what you learned about the tool/codebase
  - Build competence with development tools rather than avoiding them

Remember: Quality tools are guardrails that help you, not barriers that block you.
